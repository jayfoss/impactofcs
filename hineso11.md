# Review by Oliver Hines

This review is for Patrick Coglan's ML page on the Impact of CS
website

## Interest of Content

In general, the content is interesting on Patrick's webpage.
It is made easy to read and relevant examples are given to make
it accessible to the general reader.

Some general points about what works well and how this can be
built upon:

- Examples of ML in real life are useful to help illustrate
key ideas surrounding artificial intelligence
- The use of diagrams like the final picture on the page are
also very informative

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation

Firstly, the navigation used on the page is the same as the rest
of the website, highlighting the consistency of the page.

Moreover, the layout of the website is visually pleasing. The
use of bold text helps to highlight important parts to the
user while the bullet points help to break up large sections
of text.

One potential improvement of the site would be to create a more
interesting theme within the page instead of one that is just
black and white.

## Validity of HTML

The page appears in the expected way across a range of browsers and
devices. Moreover when passed through the HTML validating tool at
[this link](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.dur.ac.uk%2Fjerzy.n.foss%2Fimpactofcs%2Fmachine-learning.html)
there appears to be no problems with the HTML code provided.

## Evidence of Collaboration

There is significant evidence of collaboration in this project.

For example, it is obvious that the original style for the page
was created by one user and then Patrick built the content out
from here.

Moreover, the biography on this page was written by another user.

However, the majority of the commits were at the start of the week
or the end of the week.
